# GET-Book-DETAILS-SERVICE
Using ESQL #IIBV10 I am Creating a MQs protocol Service which propagates Received message with different formats to different BEs then collects replies from BEs and reply with the consumer as a single message .the received message will be a list of books and BE service will reply with the price of each book from this list.
